                            <h2>Earthquake Risks in India</h2><br>
                            India's increasing population and extensive unscientific constructions mushrooming all over, including multistoried luxury apartments, huge factory buildings, gigantic malls, supermarkets as well as warehouses and masonry buildings keep - India at high risk. During the last 15 years, the country has experienced 10 major earthquakes that have resulted in over 20,000 deaths. As per the current seismic zone map of the country (IS 1893: 2002), over 59 per cent of Indiaâ€™s land area is under threat of moderate to severe seismic hazard-; that means it is prone to shaking of MSK Intensity VII and above (BMTPC, 2006). In fact, the entire Himalayan belt is considered prone to great earthquakes of magnitude exceeding 8.0-; and in a relatively short span of about 50 years, four such earthquakes have occurred: 1897 Shillong (M8.7); 1905 Kangra (M8.0); 1934 Bihar-Nepal (M8.3); and 1950 Assam-Tibet (M8.6). Scientific publications have warned of the likelihood of the occurrence of very severe earthquakes in the Himalayan region, which could adversely affect the lives of several million people in India.

                            <h2>Do's and Don'ts</h2>
                            <strong>1. What to Do Before an Earthquake </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Repair deep plaster cracks in ceilings and foundations. Get expert advice if there are signs of structural defects.
                            Anchor overhead lighting fixtures to the ceiling.
                            Follow BIS codes relevant to your area for building standards
                            Fasten shelves securely to walls.
                            Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves.
                            Store breakable items such as bottled foods, glass, and china in low, closed cabinets with latches.
                            Hang heavy items such as pictures and mirrors away from beds, settees, and anywhere that people sit.
                            Brace overhead light and fan fixtures.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>2. Develop an emergency communication plan </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In case family members are separated from one another during an earthquake (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), develop a plan for reuniting after the disaster.
                            Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the 'family contact' after the disaster; it is often easier to call long distance. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person.

                            <strong>3. Help your community get ready
                            </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Publish a special section in your local newspaper with emergency information on earthquakes. Localize the information by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices and hospitals.
                            Conduct week-long series on locating hazards in the home.
                            Work with local emergency services and officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility impairment on what to do during an earthquake.
                            Provide tips on conducting earthquake drills in the home.
                            Interview representatives of the gas, electric, and water companies about shutting off utilities.
                            Work together in your community to apply your knowledge to building codes, retrofitting programmes, hazard hunts, and neighborhood and family emergency plans.

                            <strong>4. What to Do During an Earthquake. </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Stay as safe as possible during an earthquake. Be aware that some earthquakes are actually foreshocks and a larger earthquake might occur. Minimize your movements to a few steps that reach a nearby safe place and stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe.
