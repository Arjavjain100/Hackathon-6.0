                            <h2>Risks of Landslides in India</h2><br>
                            India has the highest mountain chain on earth, the Himalayas, which are formed due to collision of Indian and Eurasian plate, the northward movement of the Indian plate towards China causes continuous stress on the rocks rendering them friable, weak and prone to landslides and earthquakes. The slow motion of the Indian crust, about 5 cm/year accumulates stress to which natural disasters are attributed. Some landslides make unique, and unparalleled catastrophes. Landslides and avalanches are among the major hydro-geological hazards that affect large parts of India besides the Himalayas, the Northeastern hill ranges, the Western Ghats, the Nilgiris, the Eastern Ghats and the Vindhyans, in that order, covering about 15 % of the landmass. The Himalayas alone count for landslides of every fame, name and description- big and small, quick and creeping, ancient and new. The Northeastern region is badly affected by landslide problems of a bewildering variety. Landslides in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal as also those in Sikkim, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh pose chronic problems, causing recurring economic losses worth billions of rupees. A different variety of landslides, characterized by a lateritic cap, pose constant threat to the Western Ghats in the South, along the steep slopes overlooking the Konkan coast besides Nilgiris, which is highly landslide prone.

                            <h2>Do's</h2>
                            Prepare tour to hilly region according to information given by weather department or news channel.
                            Move away from landslide path or downstream valleys quickly without wasting time.
                            Keep drains clean,
                            Inspect drains for - litter, leaves, plastic bags, rubble etc.
                            Keep the weep holes open.
                            Grow more trees that can hold the soil through roots,
                            Identify areas of rock fall and subsidence of buildings, cracks that indicate landslides and move to safer areas. Even muddy river waters indicate landslides upstream.
                            Notice such signals and contact the nearest Tehsil or District Head Quarters.
                            Ensure that toe of slope is not cut, remains protected, don't uproot trees unless re-vegetation is planned.
                            Listen for unusual sounds such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together.
                            Stay alert, awake and active (3A's) during the impact or probability of impact.
                            Locate and go to shelters,
                            Try to stay with your family and companions.
                            Check for injured and trapped persons.
                            Mark path of tracking so that you can't be lost in middle of the forest.
                            Know how to give signs or how to communicate during emergency time to flying helicopters and rescue team.
                            <h2>Don'ts</h2>
                            Try to avoid construction and staying in vulnerable areas.
                            Do not panic and loose energy by crying.
                            Do not touch or walk over loose material and electrical wiring or pole.
                            Do not built houses near steep slopes and near drainage path.
                            Do not drink contaminated water directly from rivers, springs, wells but rain water if collected directly without is fine.
                            Do not move an injured person without rendering first aid unless the casualty is in immediate danger.
